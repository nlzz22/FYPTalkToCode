## Project

This project, Coding by Dictation, is a hands-free programming application. 
This application allows users to write a program by just dictating the code to the computer via voice input.
This project aims to help people with disabilities or conditions such as the Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) to write computer programs.
CTS (also known as Repetitive Strain Injury) is a medical condition which affects the median nerves of the hand, causing pain and discomfort to the user.

## Installation

Coming soon...

## Usage

Run the python file `CodingByDictationUI.py` with IDLE or any other python IDE <br />
Optionally, you can run the `cleanup.py` program after you are done using the program, to kill all the daemon threads/processes created
by the program.
